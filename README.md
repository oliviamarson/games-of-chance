# games-of-chance
Python Project
	This project includes four games of chance; Heads or Tails, Ho-Chan, High Card or Low and Roulette.
	You have a starting pot of money to bet with of Â£100.
	To play each game you must update the parameters for each function at the bottom of the code. For most of the games you need to provide the following parameters: a guess (either heads or tails, odd or even, or a number) and how much money you would like to bet.
	Finally run the code to see (1) the result in each game, (2) how much money you won or lost, and (3) the total amount of winnings you received for all four games.
